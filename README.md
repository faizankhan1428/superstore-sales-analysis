# Superstore Sales Analysis and Profit Prediction

This project explores and analyzes a retail superstore dataset to uncover business insights and build a regression model to predict profit based on sales and discounts.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (Profit Margin, Discounted Price)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Visual Insights into Sales, Profit, Discount, and Region
- Linear Regression Model for Profit Prediction
- Export of cleaned and engineered dataset

## 📁 Files

- `superstore_analysis.ipynb`: Full analysis and modeling notebook
- `cleaned_superstore_data.csv`: Final processed dataset
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/superstore-analysis.git
cd superstore-analysis

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Modeling: Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Insights Extracted

- Top cities and regions by sales and profit
- Segment-wise and category-wise performance
- Discount vs Profit patterns
- Month-wise sales and profit trends
- Linear regression for profit estimation

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Use advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Build interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash
- Connect to live databases or APIs for real-time data
